/**
 * This is a file we're going to run from the "command line" using the "node terminal command"
 * 
 * Express Documentation: https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html
 * 
 * 1. Load in "Express" & Create a new Express Application
 *  - const express = require('express');
 *  - const express = require('express');
 * 
 * 2. Customize it by telling it where our files lives & also have to tell it what "Port" it should listen on
 *    Start by telling it to serve up the "Public Folder" and everything inside
 *  - 1st: app.use(); - Is one way we can customized our "Express Server"
 *                      We are going to be using this to register some middleware 
 *                    - Middleware: Something the runs for each request (Ex. If someone want to make a request to the server => We might want to run some code to serve up some assest from the public directory or log something to the screen)
 *  - 2nd: app.use(express.static(publicPath));
 *       - express.static(publicPath): Takes an argument => Which is the "Path" to the "Public Folder"
 *       - We are going to be using the built in 'path' module => To set up our "Public Path" => 
 *         Ex. const publicPath = path.join(__dirname, '..', 'public');
 * 
 *  - 3rd: Start up the server using 'app.listen()' => Passing in a port for our server to listen to
 *       - 1st Argument: For now we are going to use "Port: 3000" => A Port available for all operating systems without getting any warning from your OS System
 *       - 2nd Argument: A "Callback Function() => {}" that just gets called when the server is up => So we can just log a simple message to the screen
 * 
 * 3. Over in the Terminal => We are going to run our "node script file" 
 *    Ex. node server/server.js
 *    NOTE: Remember to 'yarn run build:prod' your app first before starting the server => Or else it won't have the assets it need to serve things up properly
 *    ISSUES: At the moment if we traverse to a different page of our app and hit the "Refesh" button => It will not be able to be found
 *            This is because there is NO /create file or folder inside of public.
 *    SOLUTION: We need to make sure to serve up "index.html" for all files that DON'T have a "Match" => This makes sure that our "Browser Router" still works
 *            - This is something we did inside of our webpack.config.js -> { devServer: { historyApiFallback: true } } 
 * 
 *  - Ex. app.get('*', (req, res) => { res.sendFile(path.join(publicPath, 'index.html')); });
 * 
 * Recap: Setup our 15 line Express Server
 * 1. Create our Express Server
 * 2. Tell it/Point it to use the "Public" Directory/Folder => To serve up all of our static assests
 * 3. Setup: If what is requested isn't in the "Public Folder" => Then just send/give them back our "index.html"
 * 4. Setup: Point our Express Server to startup on Port: 3000
